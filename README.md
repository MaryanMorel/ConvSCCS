# ConvSCCS

ConvSCCS: convolutional self-controlled case series model for lagged adverse event detection. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08243](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08243)

This repository contains an example notebook containing the code corresponding the simulation study presented in the paper. It uses the ConvSCCS implementation available in [Tick](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick) v. 0.5.0 and Python 3.6.

The dataset used in the application on diabetic patients cannot be published due to data  privacy constraints. The cohort preparation code / software is not publicly available at the moment, but it will (hopefully) published in a near future.
